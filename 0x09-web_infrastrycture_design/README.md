I provided a series of infrastructure diagrams showing the evolution of the web server setup. The first diagram had a single web server, while the subsequent ones introduced more components:

1. One web server behind a load balancer:

This provides a basic setup with a single point of failure on the web server.

2. Three web servers behind a load balancer:

Adding more web servers improves redundancy and scalability.

The load balancer distributes traffic across the three web servers.

3. Three web servers, a load balancer, and SSL/HTTPS termination:


The addition of SSL/HTTPS termination enhances the security of the web traffic.

A monitoring computer is also included to oversee the infrastructure.

A firewall is in place to control and secure the network traffic.

4. Four web servers, two load balancers, and a monitoring computer:

This setup further improves redundancy by having two load balancers.

The four web servers allow for better load distribution and scalability.

The monitoring computer continues to provide visibility and control over the infrastructure.

These drawings demonstrate the evolution of the web server infrastructure, starting with a single point of failure and progressively adding more components to improve redundancy, security, and scalability. Please let me know if you have any other questions about the infrastructure changes depicted in the screenshots.
