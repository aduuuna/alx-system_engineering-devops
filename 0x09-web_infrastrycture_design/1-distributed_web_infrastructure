Task 2 -> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WILVLM3ffhzHURudTNH9WdtHu3hV4S1f/view?usp=sharing


1. I think we are adding additional elemnets, that is the two servers and the load balancer to address the issues we discussed in the intial web structure

Having multiple servers eliminats single point failure from the previous architecture. That is if one server goes down, otherservers can take over.
 
And also the load balancer will help distribute incoming traffic across the multiple web and application servers without performance degrading

2. The loader balancer uses the round-robbin approach which ensures that workload are evenly distributed across all servers without any single server becoming a bottleneck. So the laod balancer in the end improves performance and reliability of the website
